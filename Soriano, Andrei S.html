        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; background-color: rgb(226, 128, 194);border-radius:5%;">"Could you, could you say, uh, "I love you, Danny"?<br>
    You want me to?<br>
    Could you?<br>
    I love you, Danny<br><br>
    If you love me, baby, let me hear you say it<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br>
    First you love me then you leave me in the basement<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br><br>
    If you love me, baby, let me hear you say it<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br>
    First you love me then you leave me on the pavement<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br><br>
    I got this girl she's making me crazy<br>
    I nearly let her have all my babies<br>
    P- so good it sets me on fire<br>
    I leave myself, I elevate higher<br><br>
    You're fly girl, but you're headed to maybe<br>
    I'll take the time, treat you like a lady, yeah<br>
    My life's a spectacle, a sad story<br>
    Perhaps I find my way to the glory, yes<br><br>
    I'm the one that took you to higher heights<br>
    That's all I was trying to do<br>
    I know you had your dreams of a better life<br>
    This time we ain't making it through<br><br>
    If you love me, baby, let me hear you say it<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br>
    First you love me then you leave me in the basement<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br><br>
    If you love me, baby, let me hear you say it<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br>
    First you love me then you leave me on the pavement<br>
    I know I'm your favorite<br><br>
    You're getting on a plane<br>
    And travelling far away<br>
    You've left me with the pain<br>
    I carry it everyday<br><br>
    Who do you think you are?<br>
    Some kind of celebrity?<br>
    Just wait and see<br><br>
    I never asked for much, only that you stay true<br>
    Need I remind you all the things I do for you?<br>
    Who can I blame, I played the game?<br>
    Well just for now<br><br>
    I was wondering, can you hold me down?<br>
    I was wondering, can you hold me down?<br>
